# sumlines [--before {date}] [--] <file>

# This program takes a file as input (or STDIN if no argument or argument
#  is `-') and sums the first number on each line.  If there is no sign,
#  a `+' is added.  The format must be a floating point number (possibly
#  signed) followed by a space followed by whatever (which is ignored).
#  Comments in the input files can be made by simply prepending a `0 ',
#  that is a zero-space at the begenning of the line
#  All white-space-only or empty lines are ignored.
#  If --before is specified then only entries begore that date are used.
#  If -- is spcified that anything after it is considered a file:
#       sumlines -- -
#  will try and open a file named ``-'' in the current dir.


# Parse args.
